1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20

3. values added: 20
4. The code returns an error because the 'result' variable is declared using the 'let' keyword which only allows block scope. Hence the use of result variable outside the if-else block results in the error thrown by the terminal. 

5. The code returns a TypError because the 'result' variable is declared using the 'const' keyword which does not allow reassigning - if allready declared once. Its value is being resassigned from 0 to 20, so the compiler throws the error.
6. The code returns an error because the variable 'result ;was being used outside the if-else block its been declared in, and when const is used to declare a variable - its limited to function scope.
